## Features

- The first or second clip can be sent (optionally) without affecting the clipboard
- Clips are saved in a plain text file
- A sound is played when the clipboard changes
- The GUI of clips can be resized
- A ListView control for clips enables using the keyboard to jump directly to a clip
- The ListView can be reset (cleared) without affecting the text file of clips
- For repeated pasting, the main GUI can be set to be redisplayed after pasting clips
- Clips can be added manually via an input box
- Right-clicking an item in the list will copy it to the clipboard
- A menu option will open the text file of clips for editing, viewing, or searching
- A simple notepad is included as a temporary editing area for working with text
- The entire program consists of one portable file of less than 1 MB
